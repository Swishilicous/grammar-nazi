# grammar-nazi
A Powercord plugin that automatically punctuates, capitalizes, and spellchecks your sentences.

## Features
* Capitalizes the first letter of every sentence.
* Adds proper punctuation at the end of every sentence.
* Customizable dictionary interactable through chat commands.
* A button in the channel area container to quickly toggle.

## Note
If the plugin doesn't work make sure you have the settings you want enabled in the settings page and the button in the chatbar is green. If it still doesn't work navigate to `[PC HOME DIR]/powercord/settings/grammar-nazi.json` open the file with a text editor and reload discord.
